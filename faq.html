		            OpenCPU is a software system for embedded statistical computation and reproducible research.
		            The server exposes a web API interfacing R, Latex and Pandoc. This API is used for example to 
		            integrate statistical functionality into systems, share and execute scripts or reports on centralized servers,
		            and build R based "apps". The OpenCPU server can run either as a single-user server inside the 
		            interactive R session (for local use and development), or as a cloud server that builds on Linux and rApache.

		            An OpenCPU app is an R package which includes some web page(s) that call the R functions in the package using the OpenCPU API.
		            This makes a convenient way to develop, package and ship standalone R web applications.

		            You are asking the wrong question. The OpenCPU cloud server is designed to run on a remote server in the cloud or virtual machine. 
		            Once installed, you will be interacting with OpenCPU mostly through the API. 
		            It not recommended to host other software on the same server as OpenCPU, as R can be greedy with resources, and it is also unwise from a security point of view.

            Security is enforced using AppArmor. AppArmor is a security module for the linux kernel and enforces mandatory access control policies
            on a by-process basis. These policies can easily be customized by modifying the AppArmor profiles that ship with the OpenCPU cloud server.

            Yes! Both the OpenCPU single-user server and OpenCPU cloud server have been tested to work with <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/preview">RStudio 0.98</a> and above.

              Can the cloud server on Amazon EC2? Which instance type do I need?

            Yes, EC2 is great to get started with OpenCPU.  
            The Ubuntu team provides daily <a href="http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/">cloud images</a> for EC2, which contain a pre-installed, up-to-date, ready-to-go Ubuntu Server.
            Usually you pick the "current" image of the latest stable release of Ubuntu Server, e.g: <a href="http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/raring/current/">http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/raring/current/</a>.
            
            R and Latex require CPU more than anything else so it is recommended to pick one of the <i>compute optimized</i> instance types, for example <code>c1.medium</code> or <code>c1.xlarge</code>. 
            The c1.medium has 2 CPU's, which is pretty much the minimum required for a smooth OpenCPU server.  
            
            The small and micro EC2 instance types have only half a CPU or less, which will seriously test your patience :-)

            Finding a good provider can be a bit difficult because most providers focus on traffic, disk space and support, 
            but OpenCPU really only needs fast CPU (and some memory). 
            Get a server that has a couple of fast, uncapped, preferably private, processors. 
            Ask the provider how many and how fast the processors are and whether or not they are shared with many other users on the same machine.
            Pick a provider that offers a clean, unmanaged Ubuntu Server. Avoid anything with pre-configured control panels and all that stuff, it will only slow things down.
            Many providers offer a trial period if you ask for it. Try running some quick <a href="http://r.research.att.com/benchmarks/">R benchmarks</a> to test performance.
            If you really have no idea where to start looking, in the US <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">Rackspace</a> and 
            <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">Amazon EC2</a> are popular, and for Europe <a href="http://www.transip.eu/">TransIP</a> seems pretty good.
