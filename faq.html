	          OpenCPU is a software framework for embedded statistical computation and reproducible research.
	          The server exposes a web API interfacing R, Latex and
				    Pandoc. This API is used for example to integrate statistical functionality
				    into systems, share and execute scripts or reports on centralized servers,
				    and build R based "apps". The OpenCPU server can run either as a
				    single-user server inside the interactive R session (using httpuv), or as a
				    cloud server that builds on Linux and rApache.

            An OpenCPU app is an R package that ships with web page(s) that call the R functions in the package though the OpenCPU API.
            This provides a convenient way to develop, package and ship standalone R web applications.
            See the <a href="http://jeroenooms.github.com/opencpu-manual/opencpu-manual.pdf">server manual</a> for more information.

	          You are asking the wrong question. OpenCPU is a cloud computing service. It is designed to run on its own server in the cloud or virtual machine. 
	          Once installed, you will be interacting with OpenCPU mostly through the API. 
	          It not recommended to host other software on the same server as OpenCPU, as R can be greedy with resources, and it is also unwise from a security point of view.
