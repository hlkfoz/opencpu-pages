	  <strong>Heads Up!</strong> (last updated August 18) The OpenCPU documentation and demo servers are in the process of being updated
	  to the new OpenCPU 1.0! Unfortunately, the 1.x series is not backward-compatible with the 0.x (beta) series. A copy of the old site
	  is still available <a href="http://public.opencpu.org/legacy/">here</a>.

This page is currently being rewritten. In the mean time, have a look at the <a href="http://jeroenooms.github.com/opencpu-manual/opencpu-manual.pdf">server manual PDF</a>.
